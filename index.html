                Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a

savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,

flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with

tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients

(such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.),

which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.

A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

                 Pastry refers to a variety of doughs,

as well as the sweet and savoury baked goods made from them.

These goods are often called pastries as a synecdoche, and

the dough may be accordingly called pastry dough for clarity.

Sweetened pastries are often described as bakers' confectionery
